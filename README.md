# How to run the app
Our front end application uses the ionic framework. This provides some nice benefits, but requires a bit of up-front set up. Here is how you get started:

### Install node and npm
`npm` is the "Node Package Manager." Node is a native runtime for javascript, which normally runs in the browser. Ionic uses javascript running on node, which is why we need it.

Installing node and `npm` will be different on each operating system, but googling "how do I install node and `npm`" should get you there. Ping a teammate if you run into problems!

### Installing ionic
Get on that command line and do

```
npm install -g ionic
```

This uses `npm` to `-g`lobally `install` `ionic` (global just means it will be accessible everywhere, like your other CLI tools).

### Running ionic
Navigate into `MenuPedia/Menupedia` -- the first folder is the repo, and the inner one is the ionic project that Cesar created -- and start up the development server:

```
ionic serve
```
